# Sort algorithm using FSM and Bubble algorithm

This repository shows the implementation of a number ordering algorithm on an FPGA using VHDL.

## Use was made of

- 4 bit registers.
- The design of a state machine for the controller.

The architecture used for the design takes into account a controller and a datapath to order the data as such.

The simulations carried out were made on an FPGA, below is an image with the FPGA used.
